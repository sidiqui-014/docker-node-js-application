🧠 Dockerfile Breakdown (for beginners like me just start learning about dockerfile day day and improving myself daily)
Command	Explanation
FROM node:18	Use official Node.js 18 image
WORKDIR /usr/src/app	Set the working directory
COPY . .	Copy all files into the container
RUN npm install	Install app dependencies
EXPOSE 3000	Inform Docker about the app’s port
CMD ["npm", "start"]	Start the app when container runs
